## About This Project

This calculator, built with just about 80 lines of JavaScript, was a fun and challenging exercise in applying abstract JavaScript logic to solve basic mathematical problems ðŸ§®.

Working on this project allowed me to explore the more abstract aspects of problem-solving in JavaScript. While it's well-known that JavaScript isn't the go-to language for heavy mathematical computations.

It was a valuable exercise in using traditional programming conditional statements and functions to create a simple functional calculator, demonstrating that even with JavaScript's limitations, you can still achieve effective solutions with the right logic and approach.
