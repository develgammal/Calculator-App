**This calculator in just about 80 lines of JS Code, was an attempt to apply some abstract javaScript logic in solving basic mathematical problems. 🧮**

The logical riddles involved helped me appreciate the more abstract problem solving aspects of javaScript!

it is a known fact that JS is not exactly the best programming language when it comes to handling maths. MATLAB, R or even Python are more suitable for the task, building this calculator using JS conditional statements logic inside functions; however, was a good excercise for my JS muscles. 😅	🏋️
